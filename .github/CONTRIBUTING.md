Before filing a bug report or submitting a PR, be sure to read the contribution guidelines.

## How to use GitHub
We use GitHub exclusively for well-documented bugs, feature requests and code contributions. Communication is always in English.

## I have found a mistake
Before opening a new issue, please:
* Search for existing issues to prevent opening a duplicate one. If there is already an open, existing issue, please comment on that issue.
* Add as much information as possible. For example: add screenshots, relevant links etc.

## I want to create a patch
Community made patches, reports and contributions are very welcome and help make the Yoast Developer portal become an even better source of knowledge of all things Yoast.

When contributing please ensure you follow the guidelines below so that we can keep on top of things.

### Submitting an issue you found
Make sure your problem does not exist as an issue already by searching through [the existing issues](https://github.com/Yoast/developer-docs/issues). If you cannot find anything which resembles your problem, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/Yoast/developer-docs/issues/new).

### Fixing an issue

* Fork the repository on GitHub.
* Make the changes to your forked repository.
* Ensure you stick to the following style guide:
  * Write in American-English
  * Always write documentation as if it's being presented from the perspective of Yoast. 
  
  Example:
    :x: - "I recommend using this tool."
    
    :white_check_mark: - "We recommend using this tool."
  
  * Capitalize abbreviations (i.e. use PHP instead of php, GUI instead of gui etc.)
  * Ensure you use semantic heading levels.
* When committing, reference your issue and include a note about the fix.
* Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request to this repository.

We will review your pull request and merge when everything is in order. We will help you to make sure the code complies with the standards described above.
