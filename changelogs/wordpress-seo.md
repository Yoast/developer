= 15.1 =

Release date: 2020-10-14

Wouldn’t it be cool if you could get keyword data while working on your content in Yoast SEO? Well, we asked ourselves that same question and now we have an answer! Yes, you can now find related keyphrases inside the post editor. And it’s not any old data — no, it’s powered by our good friends at SEMrush, a world-class provider of SEO and internet marketing tools! Read more about what’s new in 15.1 in [our release post](https://yoa.st/release-15-1)!

#### Enhancements

* Adds an integration with SEMrush to search for and compare search volume of related keyphrases.
* Moves the Ryte feature toggle to the new Integrations tab where the new SEMrush feature toggle also can be found.

Using this is detrimental for performance but may be needed for some site setups.

= 15.0 =

Release date: 2020-09-29

Release date: 2020-08-18

Get ready for a brand new version of Yoast SEO! In this version you'll find new Schema functionality, an improved readability analysis for Portuguese &amp; Indonesian, and improved keyword recognition for right-to-left languages.

= 14.7 =

Release date: 2020-08-05

Say hi to Yoast SEO 14.7, chock-full of enhancements to help you with your site's SEO. Have you heard about the addition of XML sitemaps in WordPress 5.5?

Read more about those changes in [our release post](https://yoa.st/release-14-7)!

#### Bugfixes

* Fixes a bug where a fatal error would occur in sitemaps on sites where the home URL and site URL were different. Because the cause of this was a missing style sheet, the content of the sitemaps was still there, which means Google and other search engines could still reach the sitemaps and no SEO harm was done.
* Fixes a bug where reindexing would not be done for indexables without a permalink.
* Fixes a bug where an indexable's permalink remained unchanged when the categories prefix option was changed.

= 14.6 =

Release date: 2020-07-21

We have a new release for you: Yoast SEO 14.6. This release has some pretty cool enhancements. For example, we’ve added another helpful indicator in the editor that shows you your scores for a particular post quickly. Read more about those changes in [our release post](https://yoa.st/release-14-6)!

#### Enhancements

* Improves the editing experience in the Social tab, and gives it a dab of fresh paint.
* In the sharing metadata used for Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn and many other sites, we now output the post title instead of the SEO title. This prevents the brand name from being added in most cases, which is better on those platforms. You can still set a specific sharing title on the Social tab of the Yoast SEO post settings.
* Makes the plugin icon in the editor reflect the SEO and Readability score.
* Improves keyphrase counting in Indonesian by not counting '-' as a word boundary.
* Improves the feedback text for the keyphrase in title assessment to make clear that an exact keyphrase match is necessary.

* Improves the transition words analysis for Russian.
* `Noindex`es the `xmlrpc.php` file and all possible ways to request it, removing them from Google’s search results.
* For privacy reasons, no longer shows whether an email address is already subscribed to the newsletter.

#### Bugfixes

* Fixes a bug where the comment count would be output for Articles that did not accept comments. Props to [gr8shivam](https://github.com/gr8shivam).
* Fixes a bug where the social previews did not reflect the `og:image` tag correctly in situations where the first image in the content was used as a fallback.
* Fixes a bug where slashes in titles and open graph titles were removed before they were used as a replacement variable. Props to [Jon Christopher](https://github.com/jchristopher).
* Fixes a bug where a `get_plugins()` undefined error would be thrown if there was already a `plugin.php` loaded via the `init` hook by another plugin. Props to [Krishna Kant](https://github.com/lushkant).
* Fixes a bug where there was no border on the bottom of metabox tabs without any collapsible sections.
* Fixes a bug where "array_merge(): Argument #1 is not an array" issues could appear under specific circumstances. Props to [chteuchteu](https://github.com/chteuchteu).

#### Other

* Removes functions, class variables and classes that were deprecated prior to version 11.5.
* Adds a quick cache, which caches the result for 1 minute, so we don't do the same call the my.yoast.com twice on a pageload.
* Introduces the `--skip-confirmation` argument to run our wp-cli reindex command without confirmation prompt.
* Yoast SEO had many scripts that relied on many localized objects. In an effort to improve maintainability we have combined all those objects into one: `wpseoScriptData`. `wpseoPostScraperL10n` and `wpseoTermScraperL10n` remain available for backward compatibility. Plugins that tap into our objects will need to update their code.

= 14.5 =

Release date: 2020-07-08

= 14.2 =

Release date: 2020-05-26

In today's release, we’ve fixed several issues with breadcrumbs. One of these bugs turned the order of breadcrumbs on its head, which is not something we like. Things should work as expected now. We’ve also changed how we check if a focus keyphrase was used before. We currently run this against our indexable table, making the process more efficient. Read more about those changes in [our release post](https://yoa.st/release-14-2)!

#### Bugfixes

* Fixes a bug where our `select2` styling would overwrite the `select2` styling of other plugins.
* Fixes a bug where JavaScript could be executed via the error message on the Social section in the Yoast Settings. As this potentially dangerous data is not saved, abusing this was not possible.

#### Enhancements

* Optimizes the query used to check if a focus keyphrase has been previously used, by running it against our indexable table.

= 14.1 =

Release date: 2020-05-13

Despite weeks and weeks of testing Yoast SEO 14.0, there were still some people running into issues. In Yoast SEO 14.1, we’re improving things to help stabilize the plugin. Read more about those changes in [our release post](https://yoa.st/release-14-1)!

= 14.0.4 =

Release date: 2020-04-30

#### Bugfixes

* Fixes a bug where robots meta values defaulted to 0 instead of null because of a [bug in WPDB](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12819). This could result in incorrect values for `noindex`, `nofollow` , `noarchive`, `noimageindex` and/or `nosnippet`. In order to purge the wrong data, we need to truncate our tables again. This means you will have to go through the indexing process again. We’re very sorry. For sites with more than 10,000 posts, we advise using the [WP CLI command to do the indexing on the server](https://yoa.st/wp-cli-index).

= 14.0.3 =

Release date: 2020-04-30

#### Bugfixes

* Fixes a bug where running the migrations could cause fatal errors on sites where plugins are installed remotely. Some remote plugin installers don't remove files that are removed in an update. Since our migration runner goes through all migrations on the server, this could lead to fatal errors.
* Fixes a bug where the `pre_get_document_title` filter could be skipped when other plugins were using this filter as well.
* Fixes a bug where an error would be thrown when the name of an indexable table had been converted to a different case.
* Fixes a bug where a taxonomy parent would not be present in the breadcrumbs even though it was set in the breadcrumbs settings.

#### Enhancements

* Adds a missing index to the new indexables table. Props to [@pagelypete](https://github.com/pagelypete).

#### Other

* Adds the `wpseo_frontend_presentation` filter that can be used by third-party plugins to easily alter all our meta output with 1 single filter.

= 14.0.2 =

Release date: 2020-04-29

Because we’ve changed the underlying framework of our Indexables technology, we’ve chosen to rebuild the table. This means you will have to go through the indexing process again. We’re sorry. For sites with more than 10,000 posts, we advise using the [WP CLI command to do the indexing on the server](https://yoa.st/wp-cli-index).

#### Bugfixes

* Fixes a bug where a fatal error would be thrown when a title contained more than 191 characters.
* Fixes a bug where a fatal error would be thrown when a focus keyphrase contained more than 191 characters.
* Fixes a bug where a fatal error would be thrown when search engines were disallowed from indexing the site.

* Fixes a bug where a fatal error would be thrown when using the `WPSEO_Frontend` class to get the meta description.
* Fixes a bug where a fatal error would be thrown when `WPSEO_Frontend` or `WPSEO_Breadcrumbs` was called before the `init` action.
* Fixes a bug where a non-object property retrieval notice would be thrown when the site's content was being indexed.
* Fixes a bug where a trailing slash would be added to canonical URLs and some `rel="prev"` URLs, even when the permalink structure settings didn't contain that trailing slash.
* Fixes a bug where a double breadcrumb would be shown on home pages.
* Fixes a bug where the indexing would continue indefinitely under specific circumstances.

#### Other

* Removes all usages of `PDO` and `mysqli` directly and uses `wpdb` everywhere. This should prevent a lot of errors for database installations that have different encodings or configurations than what is generally seen.

Release date: 2020-04-28

* Fixes a bug where no title would be shown in the Yoast indexing status modal.
* Fixes a bug where changes made through the `wpseo_robots` filter would not be shown in the googlebot and bingbot meta tag output.

#### Other

Content analysis recalibration (beta):

* Adds a toggle feature for subscribing to the recalibration beta under SEO -&gt; General -&gt; Features.
* When the recalibration feature is enabled:

* The single title assessment is added. This assessment makes sure that you don't use superfluous H1s in your text.
* Assessments changes:
* Keyphrase density: changes scoring schema to account for the length of the keyphrase and changes feedback strings so that we give feedback about the number of occurrences rather than a percentage.
* Outbound links assessment: changes the scoring schema so that red bullet instead of an orange bullet is shown when you have no outbound links.
* Image alt attributes: if there are at least 5 images, checks whether the alt tags contain the keyphrase or synoynyms in 30-70% of all images. If there are less than 5 images, 1 image with the keyphrase or synonym in the alt tag is still scored as good.
* Keyphrase in title: function words preceding the exact match keyphrase are ignored when determining the position of the keyphrase in the title.
* Keyphrase length: makes the scoring scheme less strict for languages that don't have function word support, so that for these languages keyphrases with 1-6 words are scored as green, 7-9 as orange, and more than 9 as red.
* Keyphrase in subheading: only takes H2 and H3 level subheadings into account and changes the scoring schema so that 30%-75% of these subheadings need to include the keyphrase or its synonyms. In languages without function word support, a match is only counted if all the words from the keyphrase/synonym appear in the subheading.
* Text length: on taxonomy pages, the recommended minimum text length is increased from 150 to 250 words.
* Assessment removals:
* The assessment checking the length or your URL.
* The assessment checking whether your URL contains stopwords.

#### Enhancements

* Introduces two new principles for keyword recognition:

* Makes keyphrase recognition flexible with regards to word order. This means that the keyphrase `SEO WordPress plugin` will be found in the sentence `This is the most popular SEO plugin for WordPress.` In order to use exact matches, the keyphrase can be enclosed in quotation marks.
* When matching keyphrases for the various assessments, the analysis only targets content words and ignores function words (e.g., `the` or `and`). This functionality is available in English, German, Dutch, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Russian and Polish.

* The analysis of the following assessments incorporates the new keyword recognition principles:

* Image alt attributes: checks whether there’s at least one image with an alt tag that contains words from the keyphrase. An exact match isn’t required anymore.
* Keyphrase in introduction: checks whether words from the keyphrase are matched within one sentence in the introduction or, if not, whether they are present in the first paragraph at all. An exact match isn’t required anymore.
* Keyphrase in title: still checks whether an exact match of the keyphrase is found in (the beginning of) the title, but now also recommends improvement if all words from the keyphrase are found in the title.
* Keyphrase length: has new boundaries to check whether the keyphrase is not too long. For languages that have support for function word stripping (see above), only content words are taken into account.
* Keyphrase in meta description: checks how often all words from the keyphrase are matched within the meta description.
* Keyphrase in subheading: now checks whether at least one subheading contains more than half of the words from the keyphrase. An exact match isn’t required anymore.
* Keyphrase in slug: checks whether a sufficient number of words from the keyphrase is used in the slug. The number of words required depends on the length of the keyphrase.
* Keyphrase density: checks whether there are enough keyphrase matches; a match is defined as a sentence that contains all words from the keyphrase.
* Link focus keyphrase: the assessment that checks whether you’re using your keyphrase to link to a different article doesn't require an exact match anymore.

* Improves the feedback texts for all SEO and readability assessments.
* Improves the consistency of the SEO and readability results by showing them in a fixed order.
* Adds target="_blank" to the "How to connect to GSC" link to open the link a new tab. Props to [@zkan](https://github.com/zkan)

= 7.0 =

Release date: 2018-03-06

#### Enhancements

* Interface:

* Introduces an overhaul of the Admin settings to simplify the plugin configuration.
* Introduces a new setting to redirect attachment URLs. Previously, we had an option to redirect attachment URLs to their post parent. This didn't work for attachments that weren't attached to anything. This new setting redirects _all_ attachment URLs to the URL of the original image / media item. This is all explained on the new `Media` tab under `Search Appearance`. This setting is enabled by default for new installations.
* Moves the `Text link counter calculation` to the `Tools` submenu.
* Moves the RSS tab from `Advanced` to `Search Appearance`.
* Removes the option to remove the `replytocom` variable. We now disable this automatically with a filter (`wpseo_remove_reply_to_com`).
* Removes the option to exclude an author from the XML sitemap in favor of a broader option. Instead, we now have an option to set whether this author's archive should be visible in the search results. If you choose not to allow this archive in the search results, it's also excluded from the author sitemap.
* Removes the XML sitemaps settings page in favor of a feature toggle on the Features tab and a question in Titles &amp; Meta's "Do you want to show X in search results?".
* Moves the setting to disable the Advanced Meta Box for authors to the Features Tab. The setting now also defaults to 'On'.
* Expands the content analysis headers by default.

* JSON+LD:

* Shows JSON+LD markup for website and search on the front page.
* Makes sure JSON+LD organization markup properly links to the frontpage.

* Copy:

* Clarifies the copy on the Edit Post page to ask "Allow search engines to show this Post in search results?" instead of having a heading "Meta Robots", which was quite difficult to understand for non-SEO's. Similar changes have been made to the `follow` / `nofollow` setting.
* Introduces the question: "Allow search engines to show this `` in search results?" and bases both the `noindex` and the inclusion in XML sitemaps on this decision.
* Changes the wording in the indexing dropdown menu in the Advanced Tab of the metabox from `Yes (Default for posts)` / `Yes` / `No` to `Default for Posts, currently: Yes` / `Yes` / `No`.
* Renames the Dashboard menu item to General.



#### Other

* Adds a filter `wpseo_exclude_from_sitemap_by_post_ids` for controlling which posts are excluded from the sitemap.

* Migrates the `hideeditbox-` and `hideeditbox-tax-` settings to a saner `display-metabox-pt-` and `display-metabox-tax-` settings.

#### Bugfixes

* Hides the "Save changes" button on option tabs where there is nothing to save.
* Fixes a bug where you would not stay on the same option tab after using the save button in Safari.
* When we set `noindex` on a page, we no longer add a canonical, to prevent confusing search engines.
* Fixes an issue where the categories / tags overview pages were incorrectly showing elements marked as noindex when in reality they weren't set to noindex (and vice versa). This meant that blue bullets were being shown incorrectly.
* Fixes an issue where setting posts and pages to noindex didn't change the overview.

* Adds a new interface for the snippet preview which addresses most of the known UX issues:
* To clarify how the snippet preview can be edited, we've added an 'edit' button.

* We've gotten rid of the horribly inaccessible contenteditable elements and moved back to labeled input elements.

* We've made sure templates that are set under "Titles &amp; Metas" are well reflected in the snippet preview and editor. When they are set, they are shown as placeholder text in the input fields.
* The progress bars also take into account templates and "%%" variables, giving clearer indication if anything should still be added to the SEO title or meta description.

* Removed all functionality related to Yahoo! directory, since it no longer exists...

= 3.0 =

Release date: 2015-11-18

#### Features
* Adds realtime content analysis to the Yoast SEO metabox for all post types and taxonomies.
* Adds a tool to recalculate all SEO scores using the new client side analysis.
* Adds a content analysis plugin for parsing shortcodes before the content is analyzed. This means the snippet preview will now take the rendered content of shortcodes into account.
* Adds a content analysis plugin for parsing replace vars before the content is analyzed, allowing templates set in the Yoast SEO admin to work everywhere.
* Adds a weekly check if the homepage is indexable (in collaboration with [OnPage.org](https://en.onpage.org/lp/yoast/)).
* Adds possibility to import titles, metas and settings from the WPSEO.de plugin.
* Adds possibility to set Facebook (Opengraph), Twitter and Google+ metadata for taxonomies.

#### Enhancements
* We've completely revised the UX of the Yoast SEO metabox. We've introduced multiple sections which in turn can contain one or more tabs.
* Makes the Yoast SEO metabox on the taxonomy edit page the same as on the post edit page.
* Makes sure the capability for the General Settings menu is also `wpseo_manage_options_capability`.

#### Bugfixes

* Fixes a bug where the `og:image` would not be set, even when a default image was available.

* Fixes a bug where users would see the after-update notice, but were not allowed to visit the about page.
* Fixes a bug where we were not properly splitting taxonomy metadata when a shared taxonomy term got split through a Cron job, props [Daniel Homer](https://github.com/danielhomer).
* Other notable changes:
* Adds a JavaScript API for registering data modifications that is quite similar to `add_filter`/`apply_filters` in WordPress. Allows for filtering data before it is analyzed. See [YoastSEO.js](https://github.com/Yoast/YoastSEO.js).

* Adds a JavaScript API for adding content analysis tests, see [YoastSEO.js](https://github.com/Yoast/YoastSEO.js).

* Because we moved the entire content analysis to JavaScript, we had to remove the following PHP filters:
* `wpseo_pre_analysis_post_content`. Alternative: [Modifications API](https://github.com/Yoast/YoastSEO.js).
* `wpseo_metadesc_length`. Functionality removed.
* `wpseo_metadesc_length_reason`. Functionality removed.
* `wpseo_body_length_score`. Alternative: [Content Checks API](https://github.com/Yoast/YoastSEO.js).

* Bow out early from displaying the post/taxonomy metabox if the post/taxonomy is not public (no use adding meta data which will never be displayed).

* Improved: post meta -&gt; the keyword density calculation for non-latin, non-ideograph languages - i.e. cyrillic, hebrew etc - has been improved. Related issues [#703](https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/issues/703), [#681](https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/issues/681), [#349](https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/issues/349) and [#264](https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/issues/264).

* Fixed: post meta -&gt; often wrong meta value was shown for meta robots follow and meta robots index in post meta box so it appeared as if the chosen value was not saved correctly.
* Fixed: post meta -&gt; meta robots advanced entry could have strange (invalid) values.
* Fixed: post meta -&gt; since v1.4.22 importing from other plugins would import data even when the post already had WP SEO values, effectively overwritting (empty by choice) WPSEO fields.
* Fixed: post meta -&gt; A few of the meta values could contain line breaks where those aren't allowed.
* Fixed: taxonomy meta -&gt; breadcrumb title entry field would show for taxonomy even when breadcrumbs were not enabled
* Fixed: taxonomy meta -&gt; bug where W3TC cache for taxonomy meta data wouldn't always be refreshed when it should and sometimes would when it shouldn't
* Fixed: some things should work better now for must-use installations.
* Added sanitation/improved validation to $_GET and $_POST variables if/when they are used in a manner which could cause security issues.
* Fixed: wrong file was loaded for the get_plugin_data() function.
* Fixed: several bug-sensitive code constructs. This will probably get rid of a number of hard to figure out bugs.
* Fixed: several html validation issues.
* Prevent error when theme does not support featured images, issue [#639](https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/issues/639) as reported by [kuzudecoletaje](https://github.com/kuzudecoletaje).
