Yoast SEO exposes several APIs, which are designed to help advanced users, developers, and integrators to access and manipulate our data and outputs.

- [Our Rest API](rest-api.md), for accessing Yoast SEO metadata headlessly.
- [Our Surfaces API](surfaces-api.md), for returning information about (or properties of) a URL or post.
- [Our Metadata API](metadata-api.md), for adding or altering our meta tag outputs in the `<head>` of a document.
