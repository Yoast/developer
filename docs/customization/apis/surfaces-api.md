In Yoast SEO 14.0 we introduced a formal way of integrating Yoast SEO into your code. We've added what's called a *surface*, called `YoastSEO()`. This surface gives easy access to lots of the features Yoast SEO has to offer.

## Easily access SEO data for the current page
All of the SEO data for the current page can be easily accessed through our surface.

For example, this code provides the page's title as a variable:

```php
$title = YoastSEO()->meta->for_current_page()->title;
```

This code immediately outputs the page's meta description:

```php
echo YoastSEO()->meta->for_current_page()->description;
```

This code outputs the estimated reading time for the current page.

```php
echo (string) YoastSEO()->meta->for_current_page()->estimated_reading_time_minutes, " minutes";
```

The `current_page` surface exposes every bit of data we have on the current page, which all work in the same way; it's a long list:


| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| canonical | string | The canonical URL for the current page. |
| description | string | The meta description for the current page, if set. |
| title | string | The SEO title for the current page. |

## Deprecated properties

| open_graph_fb_app_id | string | The Facebook App ID. | Yoast SEO 15.5 (Dec 2020) |

## For other pages
Getting data for any page works in almost exactly the same way as getting data for the current page. You just need to provide an ID, or a URL.

E.g., get the canonical URL value for a post with an ID of *2*.

```php
YoastSEO()->meta->for_post( 2 )->canonical;
```

E.g., get the title of a page with a URL of `https://www.example.com/example-page/`:
```php
YoastSEO()->meta->for_url( 'https://www.example.com/example-page/' )->title;
```

NOTE: If a URL doesn't exist in our Indexables table, then this method will return `false`.

## Access to our helpers

Sometimes you need more than just the raw SEO data of a page. For instance, you need to know whether the current post type should be indexable at all. Well, our `post_type` helper can help with that:

```php
YoastSEO()->helpers->post_type->is_indexable( get_post_type() );
```

This will return a simple `boolean`.

If you want a list of indexable post types, you should use:

```php
$public_post_types = YoastSEO()->helpers->post_type->get_public_post_types();
```

The same works for taxonomies:

```php
YoastSEO()->helpers->taxonomy->is_indexable( 'category' );
```

There are quite a few of these helpers, and not all of them may be equally useful to you. But do have a look around in your IDE and see which ones we have to offer, this too is a rather large list!
