The Yoast SEO Premium's [redirects manager](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/redirects-manager/) includes automatic redirect creation and redirect request notifications. In rare cases, you may prefer to turn off some of these features.

## Disable automatic redirect creation
Yoast SEO Premium monitors for URL changes and automatically creates a redirect. In most cases, this is ideal behavior in order to prevent visitors landing on a `404` error page. However, you can disable this feature by adding the following code to your theme's `functions.php`:

### Posts and pages
```php
add_filter('Yoast\WP\SEO\post_redirect_slug_change', '__return_true' );
```

### Taxonomies (categories, tags etc)
```php
add_filter('Yoast\WP\SEO\term_redirect_slug_change', '__return_true' );
```

Note: If you see the redirect created notification and you have not changed the URL or slug, this is most commonly caused by a conflict. Please check for conflicts by following the steps in [this article](https://yoast.com/kb/how-to-check-for-plugin-conflicts).

## Disable redirect notifications
When you delete content on your site, we display a reminder notification to add a redirect for the removed item. We highly recommend adding redirects for removed items. However, you can disable this feature by adding the following code to your theme's `functions.php` file. Please note that this only hides the notification message and so redirects may still be created silently behind the scenes.

### Posts or pages: Moved to Trash
```php
add_filter('Yoast\WP\SEO\enable_notification_post_trash', '__return_false' );
```

### Posts or pages: Changed URL
```php
add_filter('Yoast\WP\SEO\enable_notification_post_slug_change', '__return_false' );
```

### Taxonomies: Moved to Trash
```php
add_filter('Yoast\WP\SEO\enable_notification_term_delete', '__return_false' );
```

### Taxonomies: Changed URL
```php
add_filter('Yoast\WP\SEO\enable_notification_term_slug_change', '__return_false' );
```
