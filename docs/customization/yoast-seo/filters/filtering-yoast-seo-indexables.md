[Indexables were introduced in Yoast SEO 14.0](https://yoast.com/innovations/indexables/) as a single source of truth for all of the pages that can be optimized on a site. Yoast SEO 18.2 introduced a new filter (`Yoast\WP\SEO\should_index_indexables`) to programmatically enable or disable the creation of indexables.

## Indexables default behavior

Per default, Yoast SEO will continuously create indexables for all the content that can be optimized on a site. This includes posts, pages, custom post types, and archives for taxonomies (categories, tags, and custom types), users, and so on.

In some cases, users may wish to disable this behaviour. When the `Yoast\WP\SEO\should_index_indexables` filter is set to false, the plugin will stop storing newly created indexables.

## Disabling indexables

In some cases, users may wish to disable the creation of indexables. When the `Yoast\WP\SEO\should_index_indexables` filter is set to false, the plugin will stop storing newly created indexables.

### Example

```php
<?php
add_filter( 'Yoast\WP\SEO\should_index_indexables', '__return_false' );
```
