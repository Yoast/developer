## PHP Coding Standards

The [Yoast PHP coding standards](https://github.com/Yoast/yoastcs) is a PHPCS ruleset which enforces a codestyle for PHP throughout all Yoast PHP code. YoastCS primarily based on the [WordPress Coding Standards](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards). In some cases we diverge from WPCS. Two examples:

1. We don't enforce Yoda style assignments.

```php
// Yoast style
if ( $foo == 'bar' ) {
  echo 'It is Yoast style!';
}

// Yoda style
if ( 'bar' == $foo ) {
  echo 'Yoda style is how this looks';
}
```

2. We put `else` on a new line.

```php
// Yoast style:
if ( $foo == 'bar' ) {
  echo 'foo bar';
}
else {
  echo 'foo is not bar';
}

// WP Coding Standards:
if ( $foo == 'bar' ) {
  echo 'foo bar';
} else {
  echo 'foo is not bar';
}
```

## JavaScript coding standards

Our [JavaScript coding standards](https://github.com/Yoast/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint) are recorded in an ESLint ruleset. There are some differences between our JavaScript and PHP rules. For example, we use CamelCase for class-, function, method- and variable names. Nowadays we only write ES6 code which we compile with tools like Webpack and Babel for backwards compatibility.

## Naming guidelines

As a developer working in a team, we want to be able to easily understand what code is all about. For this we need descriptive class-, function- and variable names. A few guidelines:

* Prevent using abbreviations, unless they are commonly used such as `www`, `http`, `SEO` etc.
* No metaphorical or cryptical names. The only acceptable metaphors are probably `needle` and `haystack`.
* In naming objects and methods, keep in mind objects are entities (nouns) and methods are the messages we send them (imperative verbs).

## Coding principles

### Keep it simple stupid (KISS)
When looking at code, it should be easy to understand what is going on. If you get stuck in dogma's about abstraction, design patterns or other coding standards, you find yourself changing code for the sake of the standard. That's a bit stupid, which explains the last S in KISS. Always use your mind and ask yourself, does this change make it easier to understand what is going on here? If you're unsure, you can always ask someone for advice!

### Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

Try to prevent writing identical functionality in different places. If there is a bug in your code, you don't want to be fixing the same bug in more than one place. When unDRY code happens, there's a good chance you can extract some of that to reusable functions or objects. Only DRY your code when the duplication actually happens and make sure the functionality is really identical instead of similar. Otherwise will find yourself untangling that code later on and lose precious time you were trying to save in the first place!

### SOLID

The [SOLID principles](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design) are a collection of principles that dictate how code should be written. These principles exist to help you structure your code in a way that is modular, makes the code easier to reason about and therefore lowers the cost of change. The S in SOLID stands for Single responsibility principle and is probably the most simple to understand. A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job. Many of these principles do not only apply to objects, but can easily be adapted to functions and modules as well. Read more in the linked article.

### Testing

Whenever writing code, it is important to ensure that it functions in an expected manner. To do this, you should write tests. At Yoast, we use [PHPUnit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit) for PHP and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for JavaScript.

A few guidelines with regards to testing:

* Even though it's common practice to only test the public interface, sometimes a lot of behavior is hidden away in a private interface. In this case, try to test the private interface via something like a test double.
* When fixing bugs, try reproducing the bug in a regression test first. A regression test is a test you write to prevent bugs from occuring again. All you have to do then is make the test pass.
* For every PR, check if the changes are covered by unit tests.

#### Test Driven Development (TDD)

TDD is a principle when you write tests before writing the actual implementation code. By working this way, you are forced to think about the problem you're trying to solve beforehand. Because tests should be isolated and small, you're also already thinking about the code you'll be writing to implement the feature. Although we don't strictly enforce this way of working, it is a good way to get into the habit of testing.

### Codescout principle

Refactoring should happen primarily through the codescout principle. That means you leave the code better than you found it. When fixing bugs or adding new features, feel free to take some time to improve the functionality that is concerned. Of course, only do this when it is really needed and remember to keep it simple.

## Other

### Try/Catch "random" functionality

Some functionality has a random success factor. For example: when doing API call you can never be certain if the API is available. We don't want our software to break on this. Wrap this kind of functionality in try/catch blocks.

### Minify .js and .css files
Please make sure you JS and CSS is minified/uglified and the minified versions are loaded in the browser. Most of our repositories have Grunt configured to do it for you. Just run `grunt build` and you'll be fine!

### PHPDocs and commenting
Make sure all your code is documented by using PHPDoc. Also use inline comments when necessary, for example when describing a difficult piece of code.
