## Filters

### `duplicate_post_excludelist_filter`
In some cases, you might not want Duplicate Post to copy custom fields when duplicating a post. This filter allows you to filter out such fields.

In either your custom plugin or your theme's `functions.php`, add the following code and filter out any custom field you don't want to be duplicated.

```php
/** 
 * Filters out custom fields from being duplicated in addition to the defaults.
 *
 * @param array $meta_excludelist The default exclusion list, based on the “Do not copy these fields” setting, plus some other field names.
 *
 * @return array The custom fields to exclude.
 */
function my_custom_fields_filter( $meta_excludelist ) {
    // Merges the defaults array with our own array of custom fields.
    return array_merge( $meta_excludelist, [ 'my_custom_field1', 'my_custom_field2' ] );
}

add_filter( 'duplicate_post_excludelist_filter', 'my_custom_fields_filter' );
```

### `duplicate_post_meta_keys_filter`
If you want to retrieve or alter custom fields' keys _after_ excluding custom fields you don't want to be duplicated, you can use this filter.

In either your custom plugin or your theme's `functions.php`, add the following code and filter the meta keys.

```php
/** 
 * Adds an additional meta key to the stack.
 *
 * @param array $meta_keys The keys of the custom fields in the original post, minus those that were previously excluded.
 *
 * @return array The custom fields.
 */
function my_custom_post_meta_keys_filter( $meta_keys ) {
    // Example: Add key my_custom_field3
    $meta_keys[] = 'my_custom_field3';

    return $meta_keys;
}

add_filter( 'duplicate_post_meta_keys_filter', 'my_custom_post_meta_keys_filter' );
```

### `duplicate_post_get_clone_post_link`

If (for some reason) you need to retrieve or alter the duplicate post link for a post, you can use this filter to do so.

In either your custom plugin or your theme's `functions.php`, add the following code and retrieve or alter the post link

```php
/** 
 * Add a custom argument to the clone post link.
 *
 * @param string $link The post clone link URL.
 *
 * @return string The post clone link URL with the added argument.
 */
function my_custom_get_clone_post_link( $link ) {
    // Example: Add a query argument to the link.
    return add_query_arg( 'my_arg', 'hello-world', $link );
}

add_filter( 'duplicate_post_get_clone_post_link', 'my_custom_get_clone_post_link' );
```

### `duplicate_post_clone_post_link`

This filter is used in conjunction with the [`duplicate_post_clone_post_link`](functions-template-tags.md#duplicate_post_clone_post_link) template tag and allows you to manipulate parts of the outputted link.

In either your custom plugin or your theme's `functions.php`, add the following code and retrieve or alter the post link's HTML

```php
/** 
 * Ensure the HTML of the post's clone link is always wrapped in a div with some custom CSS.
 *
 * @param string $link The post clone link as HTML.
 *
 * @return string The post clone link as HTML.
 */
function my_custom_clone_post_link( $link ) {
    return '<div class="my_custom_css">' . $link . '</div>';
}

add_filter( 'duplicate_post_clone_post_link', 'my_custom_clone_post_link' );
```

Now, any time you call the `duplicate_post_clone_post_link` in your theme, the outputted link will _always_ be wrapped in our custom div tag.

### `duplicate_post_enabled_post_types`

If (for some reason) you need to alter the list of post types for which the plugin is enabled, you can use this filter to do so.
It is called after the value for the option has been read from the database, so it can be used to override the settings or to enable post types that are not displayed in the Options page.

For example, in either your custom plugin or your theme's `functions.php`, add the following code to enable the plugin for the `product` post type:

```php
/** 
 * Enable the plugin for the WooCommerce "product" post type, which is unavailable by default.
 *
 * @param array $enabled_post_types The array of post type names for which the plugin is enabled.
 *
 * @return array The filtered array of post types names.
 */
function my_custom_enabled_post_types( $enabled_post_types ) {
	$enabled_post_types[] = 'product';
	return $enabled_post_types;
}
add_filter('duplicate_post_enabled_post_types', 'my_custom_enabled_post_types');
```

Now, any time you call the `duplicate_post_clone_post_link` in your theme, the outputted link will _always_ be wrapped in our custom div tag.

## Actions
