This documentation provides technical information about which OpenGraph and related tags that [Yoast SEO](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/) generates and outputs.

We output a variety of OpenGraph and similar tags in the `<head>` of each page, in order to better inform data consumers about the content of the page in question. OpenGraph data is consumed by Facebook, but also by Pinterest, LinkedIn, WhatsApp and even Google.

## OpenGraph metadata
Assuming that the respective admin settings are not disabled, these tags are output on all pages (except for _error_ templates, which are described separately).

| Tag | Description |
|---|----|
| `og:locale` | The page's language and target territory, falling back to language only. E.g., `en_US`, or simply `en`. |
| `og:type` | The type of page/resource. <br /><br />`website` on the homepage. <br />`profile` on user profile pages. <br />`article` on all pages/posts and other templates.  |
| `og:title` | The title of the page. <br /> <br /> Outputs a value based on the following hierarchy: <ul><li>A user-defined "Facebook title" value for the page.</li><li>An auto-generated "Social title" from the template in Search Appearance.</li><li>A user-defined "SEO title" for the page.</li><li>An auto-generated "SEO title" from the template in Search Appearance.</li><li>The social title default option (same as the SEO title): `%%title%% %%page%% %%sep%% %%sitename%%`. For Author & Date archives the default is just the page title.</li></ul> |
| `og:url` | The canonical URL of the page (or the series root, in the case of paginated content). |
| `og:site_name` | The name of the site. |

### Conditional tags
The following tags are only output when their conditions are met:
