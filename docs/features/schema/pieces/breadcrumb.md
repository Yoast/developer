Describes the hierarchical position a `WebPage` within a `WebSite`.

## Triggers
Should be added as top-level node in the graph, on all public pages which have a valid `WebPage`, except for 4xx and 5xx range error pages/scenarios.

## Required properties
A valid `BreadcrumbList` must have the following properties.

* `@type`: `BreadcrumbList`.
* `@id`: The site's home URL appended by `#/schema/BreadcrumbList/{{ID}}`, where `{{ID}}` is a unique identifier for the 'parent' webpage.
* `itemListElement`: An array of `ListItem` objects, representing the position of the current page in the site hierarchy, each with the following properties:
  * `position`: An integer (starting at `1`), counting the 'depth' of the page from (including) the homepage.
  * `name`: The name of the page in question, as it appears in the breadcrumb navigation.
  * `item`: The unmodified *canonical URL* of the page in question.

**Also note that:**
- _Paginated states_ should not be included/represented in the list.
- The final/current 'crumb' should omit the `item` property.

### Failure scenarios
If any of the required fields are missing or invalid, the node should not be output.

If the node is not output, any entities which would otherwise have declared a relationship with the `BreadcrumbList` should remove those references.

## Examples

### Minimum criteria

<YoastSchemaExample>
{`{
      "@context": "https://schema.org",
      "@graph": [
          {
              "@type": "BreadcrumbList",
              "@id": "https://www.example.com/#/schema/BreadcrumbList/abc123",
              "itemListElement": [
                  {
                      "@type": "ListItem",
                      "position": 1,
                      "name": "Home",
                      "item": "https://www.example.com/"
                  },
                  {
                      "@type": "ListItem",
                      "position": 2,
                      "name": "Example Section",
                      "item": "https://www.example.com/example-section/"
                  },
                  {
                      "@type": "ListItem",
                      "position": 3,
                      "name": "Example Page"
                  }
              ]
          }
      ]
}`}
</YoastSchemaExample>

## Notes on previous and future approaches
Previous implementations have used more verbose markup to describe each 'item'; however, this has been temporarily simplified in order to work around various parsing problems exhibited by Google. We may reintroduce more detail here in the future.

### Previous approach
Each `item`, except for the final/current 'crumb', had the following properties:
* `@id`: The unmodified *canonical URL* of the page in question.
* `url`: The unmodified *canonical URL* of the page in question.
* `name`: The name of the page in question, as it appears in the breadcrumb navigation.

**Additionally:**
* The `item` representing the current WebPage omitted all properties except for `@id`.
