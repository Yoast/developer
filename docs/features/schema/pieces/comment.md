Describes a review. Usually in the context of an `Article` or a `WebPage`.

## Triggers
Should be added as top-level nodes in the graph, as/when required by other nodes. E.g., when an `Article` has `comments`.

## Required properties
A valid  `Comment` must have the following properties.

* `@type`: `Comment`.
* `@id`: The site's home URL appended by `#/schema/Comment/{{ID}}`, where `{{ID}}` is a unique identifier for the comment in question.
* `about`: A reference by ID to the parent `Article` (or `WebPage`, when no Article is `present`).
* `text`: The textual content of the comment, stripping HTML tags.
* `author`: A reference by ID to the `Person` who wrote the comment.

## Failure scenarios
If any of the required fields are missing or invalid, the node should not be output.

## Optional properties
The following should be added whenever available and valid:

* `url`: The unmodified *canonical URL* of the parent `WebPage`, appended by `#comment-{{NUM}}`, where `{{NUM}}` is the database ID of the comment.

## Examples
