Describes a `Question`. Most commonly used in `FAQPage` or `QAPage` content.

## Triggers
Should be added as top-level nodes in the graph, when the content of a page contains an *FAQ block*.

## Required properties
A valid `Question` must have the following properties.

* `@type`: `Question`.
* `@id`: The site's home URL appended by `#/schema/Question/{{ID}}`, where `{{ID}}` is a unique identifier.
* `name`: The text content of the question.
* `acceptedAnswer`: An `Answer` object, with a `text` property which contains the answer to the question.

## Failure scenarios
If any of the required fields of the `Question` are missing or invalid, the node should not be output.

If a node is not output, any entities which would otherwise have declared a relationship with it should remove those references.

## Optional properties
The following should be added whenever available and valid:

* `inLanguage`: The language code for the question; e.g., `en-GB`.
