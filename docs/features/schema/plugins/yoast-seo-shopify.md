import YoastSchemaExample from '../../../../src/components/YoastSchemaExample';

This page documents the [schema.org](https://schema.org/) markup output by the Yoast SEO for Shopify app.

The output is generally consistent with our [general approach](https://developer.yoast.com/features/schema/overview), but has some minor variations due to differences in platform mechanics.

## Structured data and microdata removal

Many Shopify websites and themes include schema 'fragments'; e.g., isolated pieces of inline microdata, disconnected JSON-LD nodes, and thin or duplicate entity descriptions.
To prevent potential conflicts and errors, **we attempt to remove all existing structured data** (in JSON-LD, and in microdata formats) from theme template when our app is installed.

Most apps which add structured data functionality (e.g., reviews, recipes, etc) shouldn't be affected, provided that they don't place their scripts directly in the theme code.

## Core logic

Every page should (attempt to) output the following pieces:

- [Organization](https://developer.yoast.com/features/schema/pieces/organization)
- [Website](https://developer.yoast.com/features/schema/pieces/website)
- [Webpage](https://developer.yoast.com/features/schema/pieces/webpage)

Note that this is dependent upon the following in the app's schema settings:
- The Organization's name and logo being defined, and;
- The respective pieces being enabled.

When these criteria are met, we produce our [base script](https://developer.yoast.com/features/schema/functional-specification). In a Shopify store, this will typically looks something like the following (a composite of the above _pieces_):

</YoastSchemaExample>

## On product pages

- Change the `@type` of [`WebPage`](../pieces/webpage.md) to `ItemPage`
- Add a [`Product`](../pieces/product.md) piece (with an [`offers`](../pieces/offer.md) property).
