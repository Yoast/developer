description: An overview of how canonical URLs work in Yoast SEO.
---
Any valid, indexable page (i.e., a request which returns a 200 HTTP status, and which does *not* have a *noindex* directive) should include a canonical URL tag in the `<head>` of the document.

A valid canonical URL tag takes the following format: `<link rel="canonical" href="{{URL}}" />`

The following sections describe how the value of the `{{URL}}` component of the tag should be constructed.

## Logic per request type
The table below describes all of the request types which we consider and the structure of the canonical URL value in each case. Note that this doesn't cover every conceivable scenario or edge-case, as we only expect this specification to be typically applied within the constraints of a content management system or website.

Also note that the word 'page' is used throughout to indicate any valid, indexable result served in response to a requested URL. That includes some typically 'non-page' results, like RSS feeds.

| Request type | Notes | Canonical URL structure | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Home page | Assumes that the homepage resides at the site root. Otherwise, see Single page. | `%%protocol%%//%%hostname%%/` | `https://www.example.com/` |
| Singular page | E.g. an 'about us' page, or a blog post. | `%%protocol%%//%%hostname%%/%path%` | `https://www.example.com/about-us` |
| Taxonomy index page | Any template which lists a selection of posts or pages based on a taxonomy or similar. E.g. a category page or tag page, or a page listing all posts by a particular author. | `%%protocol%%//%%hostname%%/%path%` | `https://www.example.com/widgets`, `https://www.example.com/author/john-smith`, `https://www.example.com/color/blue`, `https://www.example.com/category/food`, `https://www.example.com/tag/size/small` |
| Date index page | Any template which lists a selection of posts or pages filtered by date. E.g, all posts which were published in a certain year, or, all pages which were added on a certain day/date. | `%%protocol%%//%%hostname%%/%date%` | `https://www.example.com/2006`, `https://www.example.com/2012-08-22`, `https://www.example.com/2019/01/30`, `https://www.example.com/date/01-20-2018`, `https://www.example.com/time/1562149536` |
| A 'data' page | An RSS/Atom/XML view which is generated by the system. E.g, a comment feed for an article or a taxonomy, or an XML sitemap. | `%%protocol%%//%%hostname%%/%path%` | `https://www.example.com/category/post/feed`, `https://www.example.com/sitemap.xml`, `https://www.example.com/blog/feed/atom` |

### Constructing the %%protocol%% variable
If the application is aware of the website's preferred protocol (e.g., a developer or user has defined an option for the site's address which includes `http` or `https`), then the protocol value should be retrieved, and a `:` character should be appended to the variable (to produce, e.g., `https:`).

If the application cannot ascertain the protocol in use, this parameter should be omitted from the permalink (resulting in a protocol-agnostic URL).

### Constructing the %%hostname%% variable
If the application is aware of the preferred address (hostname) of the website it's running on (e.g., a developer or user has defined an option for the site's address, such as www.example.com), then this value should be returned.
If there's no evidence of a preferred domain, then the request hostname should be returned.

### Constructing the %%path%% variable
The logic which determines which components are included in the `%%path%%` variable may differ by content type, by website, by platform, and by user preference/configuration.

It's also common that a resource may be requested via a variety of different path queries and structures, with little evidence as to which of these is the most 'correct'. Even when using seemingly robust platform methods, such as WordPress' `get_permalink()` function (and similar methods for taxonomy indexes, etc), there may still be some ambiguity as to whether the returned URL should be used as the canonical URL value.

Given this challenge, the following sections explore the specific logic required to return the most optimal `%%path%%` components, based on a variety of scenarios.

#### Including ancestors
Some pages may include parent directories in the URL. If the inclusion of those directories is necessary to return the page in question, then the `%%path%%` variable should also include these directories. E.g:

* A category index on a new WordPress installation may have a path of `category/blue-widgets`. In this case, the `%%path%%` should also be `category/blue-widgets`.
* An index for a content type, such as 'artists', might produce a URL pattern of, e.g., `artists/picasso`. In this case, the `%%path%%` should also be `artists/picasso`.
* An individual page about the band Pink Floyd's 1970's rock album, 'The Dark Side of the Moon' might be nested within a multi-layer category structure, and thus have a URL of `category/music/pink-floyd/dark-side-of-the-moon`. In this case, the `%%path%%` should also be `category/music/pink-floyd/dark-side-of-the-moon`.

**NOTE**: The Yoast SEO plugin contains functionality to remove the `category/` 'base' component of the path in WordPress. If this is enabled, the `category/` component should also be removed from the `%%path%%`.

#### Ancestor type preference
It's assumed in each of these cases that the user has indicated a preference for which ancestors should be used to construct the URL. E.g., in WordPress, a user may define a 'permalink structure', and decide that all posts should be preceded by their *tag*(s) (as opposed to their *categories*), or, by the word 'widgets'.

If such a preference is set, then the canonical `%%path%%` should always reflect this.

If a page can be accessed via multiple routes (e.g., where `category/widgets/example-post` and `tag/cats/example-post` both return the same page) and no ancestor type preference is set, then the `%%path%%` should select canonical ancestors based on the following order of preference when valid (adapting / using comparable concepts when there's no precise match):

* **Category**; e.g., `category/blue-widgets/page`
* **Date**; e.g., `2010/12/31/page`
* **Author**; e.g., `author/john-smith/page`
* **Tag**; e.g., `tag/color/blue/page`
* **Other taxonomy**; e.g., `cats/siamese/page`
* **The 'raw' query** for the resource; e.g., `?p=123`

#### Handling multiple ancestors
Within each of the above scenarios, it's possible that a requested page may have *multiple* valid ancestors (e.g., a post in several categories, or, a category which itself is in multiple categories).

If the user has declared a preference for a specific ancestor (e.g., a 'primary category'), then this ancestor should be used in the %%path%%.

When there's no evidence of preference, the default behaviour should be to use the first valid option, alphabetically. E.g:
* A post in categories 'cats' and 'dogs' (where *category* is the preferred ancestor structure) should have a `%%path%%` of `category/cats/example-post`.
* A post with a custom taxonomy of 'location', tagged as 'Spain' and 'Europe' (where *location* is the preferred ancestor structure, and assuming that the path root for 'location' is `location/`) should have a `%%path%%` of `location/europe/example-post`.
* A taxonomy index of pages related to 'milk' (which has parent taxonomies of both 'foods' and 'liquids', and where the path root for the taxonomy is `things/`) should have a `%%path%%` of `things/foods/milk`.

## Constructing the %%date%% variable
Date structures are used in date indexes (e.g., "all posts published in 2016"), and, when the user prefers that all posts/pages have a date root.

In both cases, we assume that the user has defined a preferred date structure/format, which may take any format (e.g., `Y/m/d`, `U`,` d-M-y`, `date/d-m-Y`, etc). If so, then the `%%path%%` should be prefixed by the preferred format (e.g., `date/22-05-2018/post-name`).

If there's no evidence of preferred format (and a page may be accessed via multiple formats, such as the raw timestamp and a 'pretty' structure), the `%%path%%` should select a canonical date format based on the following order of preference when valid (adapting / using comparable concepts when there's no precise match):

* **Y/m/d**, e.g., `2018/05/22`
* **Y-m-d**, e.g., `2018-05-22`
* **Ymd** or **ymd**, e.g., `180522`
* **U**, e.g., `1526947200`

## Other considerations

### When 'pretty permalinks' aren't in use
Some systems of configurations (or preferences) result in valid URL formats and requests being limited to 'raw' object queries. E.g:

* `?post_id=6`, rather than `category/example-post`
* `?pagename=about` rather than `about`
* `?category=cats&page=3` rather than `category/cats/page/3`

In this scenario, the canonical `%%path%%` component should match the raw query ID as above (though should omit any parameters which don't alter the query result).

Note that, in the case that 'pretty permalinks' are available, these 'raw' queries should execute a 301 redirect to the canonical equivalent.

### Trailing slashes
All of the examples in this document assume that requests don't have, or enforce, trailing slashes. In reality, this will vary by system, and by user preference. In most cases, valid pages - with the exception of 'data' pages - *do* have (and enforce, via a 301 redirect) the presence of a trailing slash.

All `%%path%%` variables, therefore, should conditionally include or exclude a trailing slash based on the following scenarios:

* **Trailing slashes are enforced on all requests**, therefore the `%%path%%` should append a trailing slash.
* **Pages** *can* **have trailing slashes appended, but, this isn't enforced** (via a 301 redirect). In this case, the `%%path%%` *should* append a trailing slash.
* **Pages do** *not* **resolve when trailing slashes are added**. In this case, `%%path%%` should *not* append a trailing slash.
* **Requests which end in a trailing represent a different resource** (e.g., `example/page` vs `exammple/folder/`). In this case, the `%%path%%` should only output the trailing slash if this is part of the valid request for the resource (e.g., on `example/folder/`).

Additionally, homepages which reside at the domain root should always include a trailing slash.

### Pagination
Some requests may accept additional parameters in order to return a paginated state. E.g., `category/page/3` (or `?category=cats&page=3`).
When this returns a valid, paginated response, the pagination component should be appended to the `%%path%%` variable. It should *not* be appended in scenarios where the addition of the pagination component does *not* result in paginated results (e.g., a request to an out of bound range).

### Sanitizing
Path values should always undergo the following treatments before being output:

* Force to lowercase.
* Encoding non-ASCII UTF-8 characters.
* Removing multiple concurrent slashes.
* Removing any querying, sorting, filtering or arbitrary queries not addressed in this document (e.g., `category/page/2/?a=b` should sanitize to `category/page/2`).
* Removing any redundant appendages (e.g., in the case that `category/post/randomstring` returns the page represented by `category/post`, the `randomstring` component should be removed).

### Compound types
Some request types may combine multiple `%%path%%` components to return a valid result. E.g., a category, filtered by date (`category/cats/2012`, or `category/cats/2012/06/02`), or a paginated state of a date-based author index (`writers/george/2006/page/2`). These components should be added to the `%%path%%`.

If these components can be applied in more than one order (and return the same, valid response), then the `%%path%%` should be constructed with the following order (if/when the components are present): `%%taxonomy%%/%%date%%/%%pagination%%`.

### Noindex'd pages
Pages which have a meta robots tag (or x-robots-tag HTTP header) with a *noindex* directive set should omit the canonical URL tag entirely. This includes scenarios where template logic dictates the *noindex* property (such as search results pages), as well as scenarios where the user has set a particular page to *noindex*.

### Error scenarios
Requests which result in errors (all scenarios leading to a 4xx or 5xx range HTTP response) should omit the canonical URL tag entirely.

## User-specified canonical URLs
When a user has manually specified a canonical URL for a page, this should override all other logic. We should output the value as-is, bypassing the sanitization and handling rules defined above.

This also applies to cross-domain canonical URLs specified by the user.

Any risks of conflict, errors or breakage should be addressed via inline warnings or validation errors during the publishing workflow.
